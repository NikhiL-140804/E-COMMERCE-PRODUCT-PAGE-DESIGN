DESCRIPTION:

As part of Task 3 of my internship, I was assigned to design a responsive and visually engaging e-commerce product page using Figma. The primary objective was to replicate a real-world product display screen, showcasing a specific item in detail — in this case, a shoe. I chose to build the layout around a modern and clean user interface that would be intuitive, visually balanced, and conversion-focused. For this project, I used Figma as my primary design tool, which provided me with a flexible canvas, precise alignment tools, and a wide array of plugins for icons, components, and color palettes. Figma also allowed me to structure layers efficiently, manage typography and colors consistently, and ensure a pixel-perfect layout.

The design started with a well-structured product display section, where I placed a high-quality image of the shoe prominently at the top left, giving it strong visual weight. Next to the image, I added the product name, a concise description, and the price. I made sure the price was bold and highlighted to draw immediate attention. A critical part of the layout was the size selection component, which I designed using rounded buttons arranged in a grid layout. Each size button reacts on hover to simulate interactivity. I also included a ratings and reviews section, where users can see an average star rating and the number of reviews, helping build trust and influence purchasing decisions. The Add to Cart button was designed with a strong primary color and rounded corners to make it stand out clearly in the visual hierarchy.

To enhance user experience, I added icons for wishlist, shopping cart, and home/navigation, placed in easily accessible areas of the screen. I ensured that the layout followed common e-commerce design principles like placing key information above the fold, using large product images, and having CTA (Call to Action) buttons visible and intuitive. I used Google Fonts (such as Poppins and Inter) for a clean and modern feel, and I maintained consistent spacing using Figma’s Auto Layout and grid tools. I also created component-based design elements for reusability, like buttons and cards, so the page could be extended into a full e-commerce app.

This task gave me valuable insights into the fundamentals of UI/UX design in retail and shopping interfaces. I learned how to prioritize content, balance aesthetics with usability, and use whitespace effectively to reduce cognitive load. Through Figma’s design features and prototyping tools, I was able to simulate user interaction, such as selecting a shoe size or adding a product to the cart. I also explored how visual hierarchy influences user flow — making sure the user sees the product image, then the name, price, and finally, the action button. In conclusion, Task 3 allowed me to strengthen my layout design skills, understand e-commerce patterns, and apply real-world design logic to create a polished, professional product page interface.
